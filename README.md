# GISTDA Wildfire U-Net Segmentation

A comprehensive deep learning pipeline for automated wildfire detection and burn area mapping using U-Net architecture and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. This project was developed for the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) to support wildfire monitoring and management across Southeast Asia.

## 🔥 Overview

This repository provides a complete end-to-end solution for wildfire detection that processes Sentinel-2 satellite imagery through multiple stages: image preprocessing, cloud masking, deep learning-based burn area classification, and geospatial analysis. The system is specifically designed for the CLMVTH region (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Thailand).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Automated Sentinel-2 Processing**: Resamples and stacks spectral bands with vegetation indices
- **Cloud Masking**: Advanced cloud detection and masking using Scene Classification Layer (SCL)
- **U-Net Deep Learning**: State-of-the-art semantic segmentation for burn area detection
- **Multi-Country Support**: Administrative boundary intersection for CLMVTH countries
- **Geospatial Output**: Generates both raster masks and polygon shapefiles
- **Memory Efficient**: Chunked processing for large satellite images
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Detailed model performance metrics and visualizations

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of five main modules:

1. **Image Preprocessing** (`classified_image_processing.py`)
   - Resamples Sentinel-2 bands to 10m resolution
   - Computes vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, BAIS2)
   - Creates compressed, tiled GeoTIFF outputs

2. **Cloud Masking** (`classified_cloud_mask.py`)
   - Uses SCL data to identify and mask clouds
   - Memory-efficient chunked processing
   - Preserves geospatial metadata

3. **Model Training** (`unet_wildfire_training.py`, `unet_wildfire_no_shape_training.py`)
   - U-Net architecture with skip connections
   - Balanced dataset handling
   - Class-weighted loss function
   - Comprehensive evaluation metrics

4. **Prediction** (`unet_wildfire_predict.py`)
   - Tiled inference for large images
   - Overlapping window processing
   - Probability and binary mask outputs

5. **Polygon Generation** (`unet_polygon.py`)
   - Converts raster masks to vector polygons
   - Administrative boundary intersection
   - Multi-country attribute assignment
